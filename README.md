# mdhex

everything is the same as dhex except that now you can pass more than two files to it

**F11** goes to the previous file, and **F12** goes to the next file<br>

## Known issues:
 - F11 seems to have some sort of delay where it just won't work
 - mashing one of the nav keys might print a character
